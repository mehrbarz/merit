    <h3>ON INTUITIVE KNOWLEDGE</h3>
    <ol>
      <a href="https://mehrbarz.wordpress.com/">
        <li>First, there is the kind which simply asserts the existence of the sense-datum, without in any way analysing
          it. </li>
      </a>
      <li>The other kind arises when the object of sense is complex, and we subject it to some degree of analysis. If,
        for instance, we see a round patch of red, we may judge 'that patch of red is round'. </li>
      <li>Another example of this kind of judgement is 'this is to the right of that', where 'this' and 'that' are seen
        simultaneously.</li>
